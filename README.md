## [Problem Statement](https://github.com/IBM-EPBL/IBM-Project-10702-1659197755/blob/main/Project%20Design%20%26%20Planning/Ideation%20Phase/Problem%20Statement.pdf) 

Personal finance entails all the financial decisions and activities that a Finance app makes your life easier by helping you to manage your finances efficiently. A personal finance app will not only help you with budgeting and accounting but also give you helpful insights about money management.


Personal finance applications will ask users to add their expenses and based on their expenses wallet balance will be updated which will be visible to the user.  Also, users can get an analysis of their expenditure in graphical forms. They have an option to set a limit for the amount to be used for that particular month if the limit is exceeded the user will be notified with an email alert.

## Motivation

Many
people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that
towards the end of the month they donâ€™t have sufficient money
to meet their needs. While this problem can arise due to low
salary, invariably it is due to poor money management skills

Using a daily expense tracker can help you keep
track of how much you spend every day and on what. At the end
of the month, we will have a clear picture of where our money is
going

This project will request the clients to add their expenses and in
view of their costs ,wallet status will be refreshed which will be
noticeable to the client

## Project Workflow

- Also, users can get an analysis of their expenditure in graphical forms.

- They have an option to set a limit for the amount to be used for that particular month if the limit is exceeded the user will be notified with an email alert
